#TEAM

Phillip Malboeuf (Founder, Developer) phil@phils.computer

##Where are each of you located? *
Montréal, Québec, Canada

##Are any founders working full-time on your product? If so, who? *
Definitely part-time, I'm a full-time freelance web developer for SMEs at the moment.

##Who writes the code for your product? *
I do, but I'm open to and I have access to outsourcing for plenty parts of it.

#COMPANY
##Have you taken prior funding? If so, how much and what structure (convertible note, priced round, etc.)? *
No prior funding, earlier stage than that I'm afraid.

##If you have one, where is your corporate entity incorporated?
-

##What kind of entity is this?
-

#TRACTION
##If you are pre-launch, list any “traction” such as number of subscribers on an email launch list, number of pre-purchases (including price), etc. *
No traction as such. If you already find that I'm too early stage, I'm okay with that and I'll keep working on things:)

##What is the URL of your marketing website? (if any)
It's still much a work in progress, but here's what I have so far: https://injustices.wiki

##How about any company social accounts? Only if they are worth checking out.

#MARKET
##What is your unfair advantage? *
My unfair advantage is that I don't have an agenda, I'm not emotionally or politically invested. My only motivation is to be able to give back. I perform all work in the spirit of service.

##What do you understand about the industry you’re selling to that few others do? *
On top of my day job as a full-stack web developer, I understand the practices of anonymity on the internet and I'm also a well-versed user experience designer. Having a combination of those skills is rare.

I also understand that there's a revolution underway, that trust in the established order is crumbling.

##If you could snap your fingers and add 3 businesses to your customer list, who would they be and why? *
So these wouldn't be necessarily customers as such, but if they could be advocates/supporters that'd be great:
http://www.injusticeanywhere.org/ (https://freeross.org/)
https://openmedia.org/
https://inequality.org/
They have the attention of our target customers and access to a base of people who could be generators of cases/content for the platform.


##Who is the ideal customer for your product? *
My ideal customer is studious and diligent, unafraid, and has suffered greatly at the hands of those above her.

##How many businesses are in your target market? *
Sorry, I'm honestly uncertain as to how to proceed to evaluate that market.

##Who are your competitors? Of your competitors, who do you fear the most? Whom do you fear the least? *
Reddit (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/JusticeServed/)
News sites (e.g. https://theintercept.com)

I fear Reddit, because it has been the origin point of mob justice, always emotional and reactive... and sometimes violent.
I don't fear news site because they're losing the trust of their readers steadily and irreparably, their biases and self-interests are showing their seams.

##What has changed such that right now is a good time for your business? *
The public is done tolerating injustices and it's asking itself what it can do to make a difference, to be a contributor instead of consumer. The existing methods to report/fight injustices are slow, expensive, inaccessible. Authority is no longer above questioning and I'd like to build a platform that enables just that.
